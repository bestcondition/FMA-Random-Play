# FMA Random Play

A tampermonkey script to add random play function to [FMA](https://freemusicarchive.org/home)

FMA is free music archive

It works good at all page, such as genre page, chart page, search page.

This is a search page example.

But there are still some bugs. One of them is that can't turn next song when focus isn't in this page.Maybe it's just because I use "window.location.href=" to redirect. I will figure it out late.
